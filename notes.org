*** emscripten filesystem

for information on how the simulated filesystem works, see emscripten's docs on that.

*** this is a development build
in the future we will want to remove not-used fonts from the build; probably do other trimming of the finally-shipped package.

i mean to look into the best way to pull in imgui, instead of committing it independently. (git submodules probably are not quite right, but something like that; conan packaging?)
