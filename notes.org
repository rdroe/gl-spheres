*** emscripten filesystem

for information on how the simulated filesystem works, see emscripten's docs on that.

*** this is a development build
in the future we will want to remove not-used fonts from the build; probably do other trimming of the finally-shipped package.

i mean to look into the best way to pull in imgui, instead of committing it independently. (git submodules probably are not quite right, but something like that; conan packaging?)

*** glm library
in the cmake file, notice that you need to link in the glm c++ library. this hard-coded path is set for a mac with a very specific version of that lib brew-installed. it will need to be changed if you try to build.
